# Dialogue Engine for Exploring Europia

This React app guides the user through a dialogue sequence written with the [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) language. The dialogue file is *dialogue.yarn*. The dialogue file is an interactive math lesson that teaches users what variables are in algebra. 

This deliverable is the start of something greater: a year-long Capstone project. Watch this space.

To run, clone the repository, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and do
[code]
npm install
npm start
[/code]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
