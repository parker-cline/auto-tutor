# A Brief Primer on Yarn Spinner

lesson_1.js contains the Yarn Spinner file as a JavaScript variable. Generally, Yarn Spinner files read like actual stories. Some notes:

- Arrows (->) reflect choices the reader can make. Sometimes, someone says something only after they make a certain choice. Indentations reflect that.
- “Nodes” are different sections of the story. In this lesson, there are two: “Start” and “Idea.” <<jump>> sends the student from one Node to another. There are a few sections where the user is stuck in an infinite loop (and so the <<jump>> command runs over and over again) until they select a certain dialogue option (they may have to test out all the options first.)
- There are variables and if-then statements.
