# Dialogue Engine for Exploring Irilia

This React app guides the user through a dialogue sequence written with the [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) language. The dialogue file is an interactive math lesson that teaches users what variables are in algebra. 

This deliverable is the start of something greater: a year-long Capstone project. Watch this space.

To run, clone the repository, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and do

npm install

npm start


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
